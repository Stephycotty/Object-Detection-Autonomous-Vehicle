# Object-Detection-Autonomous-Vehicles
The innovation of autonomous vehicles (AVs) has introduced transformative changes to the 
transport sector, enhancing safety, productivity, and convenience. Central to the effective 
operation of autonomous vehicles is the ability to accurately detect and recognize objects in 
their environment. This focuses on improving object detection capabilities using 
YOLOv5, an advanced deep-learning algorithm known for its high accuracy and real-time 
performance. The primary objective is to develop a model specifically optimized for detecting 
cars under various complex conditions. Through rigorous data collection, preprocessing, model 
training, and validation processes, this demonstrates significant improvements in 
detection accuracy and reliability.
